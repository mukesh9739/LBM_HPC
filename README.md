# Lattice Boltzmann Method Simulations

This project contains Python scripts to simulate fluid dynamics problems using the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM). It includes simulations for different flow scenarios, such as Couette flow, Poiseuille flow, and a sliding lid problem, both in single-processor and MPI-based parallel computing environments.

## File Structure

- `base.py`: Base class containing core functionalities for LBM simulations.
- `boundary.py`: Defines boundary conditions for simulations.
- `couette.py`: Simulates Couette flow using LBM.
- `neighbor.py`: Handles neighbor information for grid points in simulations.
- `poiseuille.py`: Simulates Poiseuille flow using LBM.
- `shearwave.py`: Simulates shear wave decay in a fluid.
- `slidinglid.py`: Simulates a lid-driven cavity flow using LBM.
- `slidinglidmpi.py`: Parallel version of the sliding lid simulation using MPI for distributed computing.

## Setup

To run these simulations, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project is developed using Python 3.8.

### Requirements

Install the required Python packages using:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
